Our web application is designed to be easy to use and interactive. The part that users see and interact with is called the frontend, which is created using React.js, HTML, and CSS. These technologies help make the application look nice and work smoothly.

Behind the scenes, the backend handles the important tasks. We use Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB for this. They make sure the application runs smoothly, handles multiple users, and keeps data safe and organized.

To help users find what they're looking for quickly, we have a smart search feature. It helps users search for specific things in the application and gives them results in no time.

We also have an account feature, which lets users create and manage their own profiles. It keeps their information safe and gives them a personalized experience.

Overall, our web application combines simple and efficient technologies to make it easy for users to use, find things quickly, and have a safe and personalized experience.Our web application is designed to be easy to use and interactive.
